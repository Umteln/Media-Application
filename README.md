#### TNT Videos 

A video media application use to centralize videos uploaded from a customer’s YouTube channel. This application will allow users to access all the videos from the various channels ran by TNT Media.  By making all the channels available in one place, the goal is to raise the viewer retention rate, view counts, as well as, giving users access to the company’s store to increase merchandise sales. 


#### Media Application 

This application uses the YouTube API to retrieve specific content from a specific YouTube channels. This was done using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Material UI, and Axios for data fetching.

## Reflection

While working on this project, I really wanted to get a better understanding of how to utilize the YouTube API, as well as using Axios. I had never used either before this build and really was able to gain knowledge. I struggle with trying to make my fetch request for the type of videos specific for the YouTube channels I wanted to use, but after reading over the API documentation and going through a few tutorials about the process, I was able to successfully retrieve the content. 

The purpose of the project was to get additional practice using APIs, responsive web design, use of Material UI components, and going through the steps of hosting an application. 


    * Understand the use of Rapid API platform
    * Grasp media queries for various device sizes
    * Utilize Material UI components to assist with a better 
       building process.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
